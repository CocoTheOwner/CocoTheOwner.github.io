        Since the rise of social networks, the need for effective data visualizations has paved its way. <br>
        Although many of these visualizations are useful in their own way and available for stand-alone download on the web, 
        each of them has a certain weakness to them that should be kept in mind. <br>
        This is where we thought that it is time for a change. <br> <br>
        As a result we created an easy-to-use application combining two effective visualization techniques to compensate for each of the weaknesses.
        By using edge-bundling to find patterns in data (in the form of a chord diagram), and a supporting alluvial diagram and bar for visualizing change in networks,
        we obtain the best of two worlds. <br>
        By providing the tool on the web instead of in a seperate computer program, advanced data visualization then becomes available to
        everyone. We aim to provide people with an easy-to-use, free visualization tool which they can use to go beyond simple
        graphs to explore their data.

        <!-- Since we are still working hard on our website, currently the only visualization available is a primitive
        version
        of one of the visualizations that will eventually be implemented: an hierarchical edge bundle. This type of
        visualization
        is especially good to remove clutter and discover underlying patterns between clusters or hierarchical elements.
        The visualization as it is now has a seperate color for each cluster on the circle. The lines crossing the
        circle represent a connection
        between two nodes from different clusters. The thickness of the line indicates how often a connection between
        the two nodes has occurred
        over time. In later releases we plan to make the visualization more readable and interactive as described in our
        interim report. -->
